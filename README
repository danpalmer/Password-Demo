This is a demo for a type of password that is very resistant to hacking.

The code is Objective-C for Mac OS X. It requires 10.5 (Leopard) or 
above and should be compiled using Xcode with the Xcode project file 
included.

I do not take credit for the concept, however if you use any of this code
in your own projects please credit me. If you use the code or the concept
in any projects, I would really appreciate it if you could email me to let
me know as I am keen on following the use of this type of password.

If you use this project or want to support it for any reason, you can donate
to help fund the coffee that keeps me running :)
